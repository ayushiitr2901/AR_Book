# AR_Book
This is a project made under the event name "Shrishti", where many people come together and present their technical models and projects.
This app namely "The Forbidden Book" summarise, visualize and present all the planned projects in an interactive way using 'Augmented Reality'.
The app is made on UnityEditor with an active use of C# and AR-VR Technologies.

For the Augmented Reality part to work you must scan a provided key, which I have attached a image file.
